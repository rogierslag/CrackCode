# CrackCode

The famous book for [Cracking Code interviews](http://valleytalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/CrackCode.pdf) is not only useful, but also good fun to practise your basics.
How well do you fare without your IDE or all those helper libraries you are so gotten used too?

In this case I wrote down the solutions on paper first (to go back to the basics), then typed them in vim (with all help disabled), and ran in with good old `javac` and `java`.
